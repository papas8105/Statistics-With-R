### 7.


```{r q7}
question("A clinical researcher wants to determine whether a new drug, RU-487, is more effective than RU-486.  Suppose that 100 women
         are assigned the treatment group (given RU-487) and 100 women are assigned to the control group (RU-486).  In the treatment
         group, three people became pregnant.  In the control group, nine people became pregnant.  Is there sufficient evidence at
         $\\alpha = 0.05$ to conclude that RU-487 is more effective at preventing pregnancy than RU-486?",
         answer("No, since the p-value under $\\mathcal{H}_{0}$ of no difference is approximately equal to 0.134, which 
         is greater than $\\alpha = 0.05$."),

### 8.

         the probability of winning the jackpot is either 1 in 1,000 or 1 in 1,000,000, but you have no prior information to
         tell you which of the two it is.  You play ten times, but do not win the jackpot.  What is the posterior probability

### 9.

```{r q9}
question("You are testing dice for a casino to make sure that sixes do not come up more frequently than expected. Because you do not 
         want to manually roll dice all day, you design a machine to roll a die repeatedly and record the number of sixes that come
         face up. In order to do a Bayesian analysis to test the hypothesis that p=1/6 versus p=.175, you set
         the machine to roll the die 6000 times. When you come back at the end of the day, you discover to your horror that the machine
         was unable to count higher than 999. The machine says that 999 sixes occurred. Given a prior probability of 0.8 placed on the
         hypothesis p=1/6, what is the posterior probability that the die is fair, given the censored data? Hint - to find
         the probability that at least x sixes occurred in $n$ trials with proportion p (which is the likelihood in this problem),
         use the R command 1 - pbinom(x-1, n, p).",
